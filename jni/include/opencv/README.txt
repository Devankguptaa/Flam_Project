# OpenCV Android headers note
#
# If you do not set OpenCV_DIR for CMake to locate the OpenCV Android SDK,
# you can alternatively place or symlink OpenCV headers/libraries here.
# Recommended approach remains using OpenCV_DIR pointing to the SDK's
# sdk/native/jni directory so CMake's find_package(OpenCV) works properly.
